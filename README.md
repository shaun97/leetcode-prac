## Why This Exists

This repo exists to help me not completely embarrass myself in coding interviews and maybe actually learn something along the way.

## Problems It Solves

- **The "I solved this before but where??" Problem:** No more desperately searching through random files and notebooks.
- **The "Did I actually improve?" Problem:** Git history shows my journey from "what is a for loop?" to slightly less confused.
- **The "Interview Prep Panic" Problem:** Having solutions readily available for last-minute cramming.

## How It Should Work

Simple as possible:

- Drop Python files in here
- Maybe organize them someday (probably not)
- Profit?? (Get hired hopefully)

## User Experience Goals

- Zero friction for adding new solutions
- Easy to browse when I need to refresh my memory
- Clear enough that future me won't curse past me
